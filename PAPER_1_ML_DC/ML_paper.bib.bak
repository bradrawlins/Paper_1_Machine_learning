    abstract = "{To enable the inclusion of intermittent renewable energy sources on existing power grids requires base-load coal-fired power plants to operate flexibly, including fast load changes and continuous low-load operation. Low-load operation of a 620 MWe sub-critical boiler is analysed with the aid of a co-simulation methodology that incorporates a detail three dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model together with a one dimensional process model. A discretized one dimensional model of the water/steam circuit was developed for the furnace, the radiant superheaters and the convective/back pass heat exchangers. This is coupled with a detailed CFD model incorporating the furnace and radiant superheaters using a Eulerian-Eulerian reference frame. The coupled model is used to investigate the combustion stability, water/steam side effects, and the radiant heat exchanger operational limits for six different burner firing arrangements at a low boiler load of 32\\% of Maximum Continuous Rating. The results show that certain firing arrangements can lead to a high risk of fire-side corrosion and overheating of heat exchanger components. Based on analyses of combustion stability, boiler efficiency and the safe operation of heat exchanger components, a mixed firing arrangement with a higher secondary air mass flowrate for non-firing burners was selected as the best operational strategy at this low load for the boiler under investigation.}",

abstract = {Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion is a new clean coal technology with advantages of wide fuel flexibility and low pollutant emissions. The bed temperature of CFB boilers is an important factor that influences operating security and pollutant emission generation. An accurate model to describe the dynamic characteristics of bed temperature is beneficial in reducing temperature fluctuations. This study presents a dynamic model for predicting the bed temperature of a 300 MW CFB boiler based on the least squares support vector machine method with real operational data. Coal feed rate and primary air rate are selected as the independent variables. The current values and previous sequences of the variables are considered as the model inputs to describe the dynamic characteristics of bed temperature. In addition, the past values of bed temperature are taken as feedback and then added to the inputs. The particle swarm optimization technique is used to determine optimal delay orders. Several model patterns are also discussed and compared. Comparison results show that the proposed model structure is reasonable and that the model can achieve the accurate prediction of the bed temperature.},

@article{Cui2022,
abstract = {The supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) power cycle has a wide application prospect in coal-fired power generation field because it's highly effective, compactly structured, and flexible of operation. To observe more accurate heat transfer and coal combustion characteristics in the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) with the distinctive S-CO2 boundary, a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the furnace-side combustion process treated by the multiphase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) method was conducted in a 600 MW S-CO2 CFB boiler coupled with the heat transfer process on working fluid side based on the polynomial fitting calculation model. Furthermore, a novel method to predict simulation results via Radial Base Function (RBF) neural network was proposed to simplify the computational process, enhance the sample data fusion, and improve the prediction accuracy. Results show that staggered high-temperature fluid and high heat flux was a major concern in S-CO2 heating surface arrangement. The temperature rise of wall heaters was less than the conventional steam CFB, and the heat flux of spiral and vertical heat transfer tubes decreased along the tube. The predicted temperature distribution of tubes and cold walls was in a good agreement with the coupling simulation results, whose accuracy can meet the engineering requirements.},

@article{Schuhbauer2014,
abstract = {This paper presents the coupled simulation of steam cycle and firing of the 700 C boiler. The focus is on the implementation of the coupling algorithm and the modification of the implemented ANSYS FLUENT models to adjust the simulation to the specific boundary conditions of a pulverized coal combustion in a tower-type boiler. Therefore the necessary simulation fundamentals are explained. This includes the used software packages and the combustion modeling in ANSYS FLUENT as well as the coupling algorithm developed. In addition, the required modifications of the ANSYS FLUENT models are described in more detail to provide a realistic boiler simulation. For the validation, the simulation results for the full load case are compared with the thermodynamic design data by the manufacturer ALSTOM Boiler Deutschland. The combustion simulation shows that the porous media model - used for the convective heat exchangers - has to be improved. The main problem is that the model cannot correctly participate in the radiation because the tube surfaces are not represented in the model. So the radiation interaction between combustion chamber and porous media is not correctly modeled. To correct this error, a source term is implemented. Furthermore, the emissivity of the walls is modified to consider the wall shadowing effects in the convective part as well as the radiation between the convective heat exchangers. The heat radiation in coal-fired boilers is highly complex, so the implemented models can be seen as an approximation. Given this background, the high agreement with the target values of the thermodynamic design can be seen as very positive. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rousseau2020,
abstract = {The burning of very high ash coal can adversely affect heat absorption in boiler furnaces and radiant superheater heat exchangers, while the lower calorific value can lead to lower bulk furnace temperatures and higher tube wall temperatures in the radiative superheaters. This paper presents the results of a numerical study that compares the heat transfer characteristics of a subcritical boiler firing coal with a very high ash content to that of the same boiler burning the original design coal. The analysis is based on a detailed furnace combustion and heat transfer CFD model using ANSYS Fluent{\textregistered}, applied in a co-simulation mode together with a system level thermofluid network model using Flownex{\textregistered} SE. Furthermore, the particulate radiation models include the effects of variable emissivity and scattering as the particles transition from parent fuel to ash. The aim is to demonstrate the extent to which the effects of differences in the coal quality can be identified in utility scale boilers using this approach. The results show that it is possible to identify the impact on furnace and radiant heat exchanger heat uptake, steam generation rate, as well as potential areas of high heat exchanger tube wall temperatures.},

@article{Fei2015,
abstract = {A new approach has been developed in order to estimate the potential of retrofitting an existing power plant to oxy-firing and the safe operation regime of the retrofitted boiler under oxy-combustion condition has been determined. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques have been employed to simulate the coal combustion and heat transfer to the furnace water walls and heat exchangers under air-firing and oxy-firing conditions. A set of reduced order models (ROM) has been developed to link the CFD predictions to the whole plant process model in order to simulate the performance of the power plant under different load and oxygen enrichment conditions in an efficient manner. Simulation results of a 500° MWe power plant unit indicate that it is possible to retrofit it to oxy-firing without affecting its overall performance. Further, the feasible range of oxygen enrichment for different power loads is identified to be between 25{\%} and 27{\%}. However, the peak temperature on the superheater platen 2 may increase in the oxy-coal mode at a high power load beyond 450° MWe.},

abstract = {The oxy-fuel combustion CFB technology as a promising carbon capture technologies needs to study the scale-up process for the commercial diffusion. Numerical simulation would be a rational tool to investigate the gas-solid flow and oxy-fuel combustion process before constructing an expensive and complicated industry-scale plant. A three-dimensional (3D) CFD simulation according to the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flow and oxy-fuel combustion process in lab-scale, pilot-scale and industry-scale CFB boiler (from 0.1 MWth to 330 MWe). Results present the differences of the boiler configuration, the gas-solid flow and the oxy-fuel combustion characteristics between lab-scale, pilot-scale and industry-scale CFB boilers. The cross-section thermal load gradually decreased, while the cross-section area increased with the thermal inputs increased. In the lab-scale and pilot-scale oxy-fuel CFB, the particle velocity field was more uniform than that in the industry-scale CFB. The carbon conversion ratio increased with an increase in the thermal input. The emission of CO, NO and SO2 in the industry-scale oxy-fuel CFB boilers was lower than those in the lab-scale and pilot-scale. A larger oxy-fuel combustion power plant is beneficial to carbon capture and low pollutant emission. The results would be beneficial to the design and operation of industry-scale oxy-fuel CFB.},

abstract = {Co-simulation of the high-temperature heat and mass transfer processes in coal-fired boilers using CFD together with process-level models of the water/steam circuit is a promising approach to investigate off-design conditions. In the present work, a 1D discretized two-phase model of the water flows in the evaporator and radiative superheaters was developed. This was coupled with a detailed furnace combustion and heat transfer CFD model. The coupled models are used to investigate the impact of variable particle emissivity and scattering efficiency on the evaporator and radiant superheater process conditions, including the furnace steam generation rate and final steam temperature. The results are compared with the case where the radiation properties of the particles are assumed to be constant, thereby highlighting the importance of accounting for the variations in the particle properties throughout the process. The case study boiler is that of a real 620 MWe subcritical power plant firing coal with a high ash content (41 {\%}wt). The results show that the constant property model results in a predicted furnace heat load that is 6.5{\%} lower than the experimental value, while the conversion-dependent model is only 0.7{\%} lower than the experimental value.},

abstract = {We report on numerical analysis of the effects of inflow conditions on sub-optimal combustion in a coal-dust utility boiler of 230 MWe, believed to be the cause of the observed high-temperature corrosion on fireside membrane walls in the furnace diffuser. To this purpose, a precursor simulation of coal-air mixture in a real double-swirl burner in its full complexity was carried out, and the results extrapolated to 24 burner exits for the simulation of combustion in the boiler. The simulations were performed using Ansys Fluent CFD software for solving RANS equations for turbulent flow, combustion of dispersed coal-dust particles, species transport and reactions with the standard chemical kinetics and radiation models. The comparison of combustion results obtained with precursor burner simulations and those with the commonly imposed uniform burner-exit properties revealed considerable differences in the furnace diffuser. Especially notable are different distributions of CO and O2 concentrations in the burner-exits near field, which are suspected to be the precursors of the membrane wall corrosion. The simulation of the burner reveals also a sub-optimal and incomplete coal - air mixing with a consequent non-uniform and asymmetric particles distribution in the mixture entering the furnace.},

abstract = {Pulverized coal-fired power plants will remain a significant part of the electricity generation mix for years to come but should not restrict generation from clean renewable energy sources. Enhancing their flexibility is therefore crucial to achieving the required power system transformation. Predicting the furnace membrane wall temperatures is important in the study of flexible operation. This paper presents a new thermofluid network-based model for membrane walls of pulverized coal boiler furnaces to enable the study of power plant flexibility. The relevant thermal resistance formulations are derived together with the effective overall heat transfer coefficient. Detail results show that the model scales very well to different geometries and operating conditions that cover the full range of operation of typical sub- and supercritical pulverized coal boilers, including very low loads. The overall UA value is predicted to within 5{\%} of the benchmark CFD results for all the cases presented, except for the case of a very thick tube wall, while the predicted temperatures are all within 4{\%}. The results therefore provide confidence that the model can be applied with good accuracy over the full range of operating conditions and waterwall geometries for both sub- and supercritical boilers.},

@article{Liu2021,
abstract = {Burnout related problem occurs in the utility boiler burning low volatile coals. The in-furnace co-firing of low volatile coal (LV) experiments and simulation were carried out in a tangentially fired PC furnace to investigate the effect of co-firing ratio, injection position and particle size on NOx emission and carbon in fly ash (Cfh). The results of full-scale experiment show that Cfh increases from 2.16{\%} to 4.21{\%} as the LV co-firing ratio rises from 33{\%} to 50{\%}, while the NOx emission increases from 356.0 mg/Nm3 to 385.2 mg/Nm3 (@6{\%} O2). The model is validated against the experimental data. The numerical simulation results show that NOx increases from 308 mg/Nm3 to 567 mg/Nm3 when the co-firing ratio of LV increases from 0{\%} to 100{\%}, while Cfh increases from 1.20{\%} to 7.15{\%}. It is found that the contribution of top two layers (E and F) to the total Cfh is significantly higher than that of the other layers. Under the working conditions of burning bituminous coal in the bottom layer and lean coal (particle size 70 $\mu$m) in the upper five layers, Cfh is 5.4{\%}. When the particle size of lean coal in the five layers is reduced to 40 $\mu$m, Cfh rapidly decreases to 2.0{\%}. And the Cfh can be reduced to 2.5{\%} when only the top two layers feeding lean coal with smaller particle size (40 $\mu$m). Only 40{\%} marginal cost of coal grinding is needed to reach the marginal benefit corresponding to 83{\%} Cfh improvement while all layers of LV coal are ground into the small size.},

abstract = {Deployment of renewables introduces new regimes of large scale boiler operation. The units are required to operate at flexible rather than baseload mode. One of the requirements is to reduce the minimum load of the existing boilers which adds thermal stress to pressure parts. Significant operational issue is the local overheating of the heat exchangers material due to lower steam flow rates and poor heat dissipation conditions. The problem is particularly intensified in low-pressure reheaters. The current paper demonstrates a novel computational method of predicting tube metal temperature of specific reheater platens. The proposed numerical procedure incorporates coupling of CFD simulations of the boiler fire side with 1-D pipe flow model in the heat exchanger. Simulation results are compared to measurement data. The numerical method can be used to make decision on the modification strategy of the reheater design to achieve uniform temperatures of the tube metal in each platen by restriction orifices adjustment.},

abstract = {Increasing penetration of renewable energy sources to the power grid has prompted new ramping scenarios to dispatchable thermal power plants to balance the variability caused by intermittent renewable supplies. With many thermal power plants designed to be base-loaded, ramping of the power output results in increased emission of pollutants. This study develops a dynamic data-driven model of a coal-fired utility boiler that estimates NOx and CO emissions simultaneously. Given a production schedule of a power plant, estimation of NOx and CO emissions for 3 h into the future is performed that can be further utilized in a dynamic optimization algorithm to minimize the emissions over a horizon. It is observed that a dynamic model always has a higher prediction accuracy than a static model, when training and forecasting of the models are concerned. Application of dynamic and steady-state optimization also results in reduced emissions as compared to historical plant emissions.},

@article{Lu2021,
abstract = {A thermoelectric coupling limitation imposes the combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems low performance under dynamic uncertainty. Energy storage is an effective way to address the problem. This paper integrates an energy storage device into the CCHP system to decouple the limitation and proposes a multi-objective optimization model considering load uncertainty for the optimal capacity of energy storage. The design space is a set of all feasible configuration schemes that meet the requirements of the system's confidence level. A chance-constrained method is employed to address the load uncertainty and transform the uncertain optimization into deterministic optimization. Load uncertainty is closely related to the given confidence level. Therefore, the indicator loss of load expectation is used to evaluate the reliability of the CCHP system. The economic and environmental performance of the CCHP system is assessed by using the annual total cost and carbon dioxide emission, respectively. A hotel example validates the feasibility of the proposed methodology. The results show that increasing the confidence level from 0.5 to 0.99 results in the capacity increase of the waste heat boiler from 326.8 kW to 408.2 kW in the heating mode. The increased change reduces the loss of load expectation by 108.4{\%} and increases the annual operation cost by 110.14{\%}.},

abstract = {Essentials of Monte Carlo Simulation focuses on the fundamentals of Monte Carlo methods using basic computer simulation techniques. The theories presented in this text deal with systems that are too complex to solve analytically. As a result, readers are given a system of interest and constructs using computer code, as well as algorithmic models to emulate how the system works internally. After the models are run several times, in a random sample way, the data for each output variable(s) of interest is analyzed by ordinary statistical methods. This book features 11 comprehensive chapters, and discusses such key topics as random number generators, multivariate random variates, and continuous random variates. Over 100 numerical examples are presented as part of the appendix to illustrate useful real world applications. The text also contains an easy to read presentation with minimal use of difficult mathematical concepts. Very little has been published in the area of computer Monte Carlo simulation methods, and this book will appeal to students and researchers in the fields of Mathematics and Statistics.},

abstract = {This paper describes a CFD modelling methodology used to evaluate the thermal performance of the water wall evaporator, platen and final stage superheaters of a subcritical pulverized coal-fired boiler at full and reduced boiler loads. The heat exchanger elements are modelled as explicit walls with an effective thermal resistance boundary condition rather than fixed wall temperatures. This enables the direct radiation component to be properly accounted for together with variations in the wall temperatures. The modelling approach was applied to the boiler of a 620 MWe power plant. The results for 99{\%}, 81{\%} and 60{\%} boiler loads compare well with experimental data. The proposed methodology forms the bases for a co-simulation framework which combines the CFD with a systems-level process modelling tool that can capture the internal steam maldistribution at low loads and the resultant effect on the metal temperatures.},

abstract = {A comprehensive thermal model of a combine harvester air conditioning system is developed to study the transient cool-down phenomena in the cabin. The proposed simulation framework encompasses a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that relies on an artificial neural network (ANN) which actively receives data on the performance of the refrigeration cycle in order to update the thermal state of the cabin. The refrigeration cycle is modeled using a 1D methodology to predict the heat absorption capacity of the evaporator at a wide range of operating conditions. The data generated by the 1D model is then utilized to train the ANN model with airflow, relative humidity (RH) and air temperature as input parameters and evaporator heat absorption as the output. The trained ANN model is integrated with the CFD model of the cabin allowing a realistic transient response of the evaporator based on the instantaneous thermal state of the cabin air. The proposed simulation framework exploits the versatility of ANN to simplify the overall complexity of the model and removes the necessity of 1D/3D co-simulation being the conventional method for this type of problems. The predicted transient thermal state of the cabin air is validated against experimental data and a substantial coherence of the numerical and experimental results is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Minimization of a sum-of-squares or cross-entropy error function leads to network out- puts which approximate the conditional averages of the target data, conditioned on the input vector. For classi?cations problems, with a suitably chosen target coding scheme, these averages represent the posterior probabilities of class membership, and so can be regarded as optimal. For problems involving the prediction of continuous variables, how- ever, the conditional averages provide only a very limited description of the properties of the target variables. This is particularly true for problems in which the mapping to be learned is multi-valued, as often arises in the solution of inverse problems, since the average of several correct target values is not necessarily itself a correct value. In order to obtain a complete description of the data, for the purposes of predicting the outputs cor- responding to new input vectors, we must model the conditional probability distribution of the target data, again conditioned on the input vector. In this paper we introduce a new class of network models obtained by combining a conventional neural network with a mixture density model. The complete system is called a Mixture Density Network, and can in principle represent arbitrary conditional probability distributions in the same way that a conventional neural network can represent arbitrary functions. We demonstrate the e?ectiveness of Mixture Density Networks using both a toy problem and a problem involving robot inverse kinematics.},

A new algorithm called best network after multiple iterations (BNMI) is introduced to help in determining the appropriate ANN architecture. The prediction performance of the developed models using BNMI algorithm was significantly better (between 6{\%} and 59{\%} better goodness of fit for various models) when compared to a previous study carried out by the authors which used the default single iteration ANN training algorithm of MATLAB{\textregistered}. The ANN models were further used to design the supervisory MPC for the residential HVAC system. The MPC generated the dynamic temperature set-point profiles of the zone air and buffer tank water which resulted in the operating cost reduction of the equipment without violating the thermal comfort constraints. When compared to the fixed set-point (FSP), MPC was able to save operating cost between 6{\%} and 73{\%} depending on the season.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations have played a vital role in the design of modern combustion systems. Over the last two decades, the focus of research has been on the development of the large eddy simulation (LES) approach, which leveraged the vast increase in computing power to dramatically improve predictive accuracy. Even with the anticipated increase in supercomputing capabilities, the use of LES in design is limited by its high computational cost. Moreover, to aid decision making, such LES computations have to be augmented to estimate underlying uncertainties in simulation components. At the same time, other changes are happening across industries that build or use combustion devices. While efficiency and emissions reduction are still the primary design objectives, reducing cost of operation by optimizing maintenance and repair is becoming an important segment of the enterprise. This latter quest is aided by the digitization of combustors, which allows collection and storage of operational data from a host of sensors over a fleet of devices. Moreover, several levels of computing including low-power hardware present on board the combustion systems are becoming available. Such large data sets create unique opportunities for design and maintenance if appropriate numerical tools are made available. As LES revolutionized computing-guided design by leveraging supercomputing, a new generation of numerical approaches is needed to utilize this vast amount of data and the varied nature of computing hardware. In this article, a review of emerging computational approaches for this heterogeneous data-driven environment is provided. A case is made that new but unconventional opportunities for physics-based combustion modeling exist in this realm.},

abstract = {There is increasing need for tighter controls of coal-fired plants due to more stringent regulations and addition of more renewable sources in the electricity grid. Achieving this will require better process knowledge which can be facilitated through the use of plant models. Drum-boilers, a key component of coal-fired subcritical power plants, have complicated characteristics and require highly complex routines for the dynamic characteristics to be accurately modelled. Development of such routines is laborious and due to computational requirements they are often unfit for control purposes. On the other hand, simpler lumped and semi empirical models may not represent the process well. As a result, data-driven approach based on neural networks is chosen in this study. Models derived with this approach incorporate all the complex underlying physics and performs very well so long as it is used within the range of conditions on which it was developed. The model can be used for studying plant dynamics and design of controllers. Dynamic model of the drum-boiler was developed in this study using NARX neural networks. The model predictions showed good agreement with actual outputs of the drum-boiler (drum pressure and water level).},

They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data, are able to deal with non-linear problems, and once trained can perform predictions and generalisations at high speed. They have been used in diverse applications in control, robotics, pattern recognition, forecasting, medicine, power systems, manufacturing, optimisation, signal processing, and social/psychological sciences. They are particularly useful in system modelling, such as in implementing complex mapping and system identification. This paper presents various applications of neural networks in energy problems in a thematic rather than a chronological or any other way. Artificial neural networks have been used by the author in the field of solar energy; for modelling and design of a solar steam generating plant, for the estimation of a parabolic-trough collector's intercept factor and local concentration ratio and for the modelling and performance prediction of solar water-heating systems. They have also been used for the estimation of heating-loads of buildings, for the prediction of air flows in a naturally ventilated test room and for the prediction of the energy consumption of a passive solar building. In all such models, a multiple hidden-layer architecture has been used. Errors reported when using these models are well within acceptable limits, which clearly suggests that artificial neural-networks can be used for modelling in other fields of energy production and use. The work of other researchers in the field of energy is also reported. This includes the use of artificial neural-networks in heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, solar radiation, modelling and control of power-generation systems, load-forecasting and refrigeration. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Backpressure has a direct impact on thermal power plant generated load. The current study compares deterministic models (standard RNNs) to probabilistic models (MDN-RNNs). This is done using three datasets with increasing complexity to understand how significant the effects of plant operating parameters and ambient conditions are on the ACC back pressure. A hyperparameter search was performed to find the best encoder-decoder RNN architecture. An MDN layer was then attached to the selected architectures, to develop models capable of predicting the uncertainty. A two-layer encoder-decoder MDN-RNN model was selected and then trained with and without early stopping regularization active. The resultant models were combined using an ensemble approach. It was found that the ensemble model was able to achieve a better prediction of outliers without overfitting the data. The basic model, a standard RNN with the smallest input dimensionality achieved an average RMSE of 5.66 kPa whereas the end-to-end ensemble model (meta-MDN model trained using the highest dimensionality input) achieved an RMSE of 3.14 kPa which translate into a model accuracy increase from 68{\%} to 82{\%}.},

The VAE model is used to generate low dimensional encodings of the CFD data and the DNN is used in turn to map boundary conditions to the encodings. The results show that regularization is required during all training phases. Sufficiently accurate results were achieved for the reproduced species mass fractions with mean average errors below 0.3 [{\%}wt.].

The boiler was retrofitted by replacing traditional jet burners with RI-JET2 (Rapid Ignition - JET) swirl burners. This kind of solution is unique in power generation systems. The purpose of this work is to show how the flow, combustion performance and heat exchange in the furnace are affected by introducing rapid ignition phenomena in RI-JET2 burners instead of delayed ignition associated with the traditional jet burners. Results were compared to simulations of similarly designed boiler equipped with traditional jet burners. Furnace simulation was preceded with a single RI-JET2 burner simulation at the inlet to a virtual combustion chamber. The results have shown that pulverized coal (PC) concentrator separates the PC into two streams: concentric with fine particles and axial with coarse particles. Stable flame operation was noticed even without secondary and tertiary air swirl. 3D simulations of combustion chamber have shown that in a burner zone a visibly isolated, concentrated flame exists in the furnace axis.

In this method, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models are established for predicting the boiler operating and emission properties. To enhance the generalization of the ANN models, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is performed to generate some data as training samples for ANN modeling, together with the historical operating data. The inputs of the ANN models are unit load, coal properties, excess air and air distribution scheme, and the outputs are thermal efficiency and NOx emission. Based on the ANN models, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the air distribution scheme to achieve a higher thermal efficiency and lower NOx emission simultaneously. The predictions of the thermal efficiency and NOx emissions show a good agreement with the plant data, with mean errors of 0.04{\%} and 3.56 mg/Nm3, respectively. The results indicate that the use of CFD data can help generalize the ANN models.

abstract = {A data-driven surrogate model is proposed for a 64-cell air-cooled condenser system at a power plant. The surrogate model was developed using thermofluid simulation data from an existing detailed 1-D thermofluid network simulation model. The thermofluid network model requires a minimum of 20 min to solve for a single set of inputs. With operating conditions fluctuating constantly, performance predictions are required in shorter intervals, leading to the development of a surrogate model. Simulation data covered three operating scopes across a range of ambient air temperatures, inlet steam mass flow rates, number of operating cells, and wind speeds. The surrogate model uses multi-layer perceptron deep neural networks in the form of a binary classifier network to avoid extrapolation from the simulation dataset, and a regression network to provide performance predictions, including the steady-state backpressure, heat rejections, air mass flowrates, and fan motor powers on a system level. The integrated surrogate model had an average relative error of 0.3{\%} on the test set, while the binary classifier had a 99.85{\%} classification accuracy, indicating sufficient generalisation. The surrogate model was validated using site-data covering 10 days of operation for the case-study ACC system, providing backpressure predictions for all 1967 input samples within a few seconds of compute time. Approximately 93.5{\%} of backpressure predictions were within ±6{\%} of the recorded backpressures, indicating sufficient accuracy of the surrogate model with a significant decrease in compute time.},

abstract = {The arch-fired boiler easily suffers from membrane wall deformation and rupture caused by high stress. Thus, it is necessary to predict thermal stress distribution on the membrane wall for the sake of early warning. In this study, a lab-scale arch-fired boiler was constructed to achieve thermal stress distribution on the membrane wall, and the reason for high-stress formation was found. Besides, machine learning technology was first applied to predict thermal stress based on experimental data. The results show that both high-temperature distribution and boiler configuration play an important role on high-stress distribution. As for the prediction, the regression neural network model presents an admissible result (R2 = 0.724), but has a relatively poor performance on the high-stress prediction due to the skewed data distribution. Specifically, the relatively high prediction errors present on the bending and connection areas. Future work should consider the effect of boiler configuration and different heat loads. In contrast, the binary classification neural network model has a more accurate result with a high F1 score (0.893). It is the best choice for practical application considering the generality and accuracy. This work is meant to be valuable in optimizing the prediction model and applying it in practice.},

abstract = {We describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal 'hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure 1. {\textcopyright} 1986 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Coal blends are commonly used in pulverised fuel fired power plants. Past experience has shown that some coals exhibit synergistic effects when co-fired with other coals. Despite the recent progress in the field, there is still a general lack of understanding about how and why such synergistic effects take place. It is, therefore, imperative to develop reliable techniques to predict the combustion characteristics of coal blends. In the present paper, a commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, known as Fluent, is applied to simulate the combustion of binary coal blends of Australian black coals in a pilot-scale furnace. The modelling was mainly concerned with employing the two-mixture-fraction-pdf approach to separately track the individual components of each blend. Additionally, another approach, which takes the blend as a single coal with the weighted average properties of the components, was also used and compared. The main combustion characteristics of coal blends, such as ignition, burnout and NOx emissions were studied and corresponding predictions were validated against measurements in a pilot-scale furnace. The comparisons indicated that the CFD model with the two mixture fraction approach can successfully predict the non-additive (synergistic) combustion behaviour of coal blends, providing an effective tool for full-scale applications. The single coal approach presents nearly additive prediction of coal bends, and is only applicable to the blends of similar coals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
