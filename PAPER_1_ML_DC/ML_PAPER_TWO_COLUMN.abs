An integrated data-driven surrogate model and one-dimensional (1D) process model of a 620 $MW_e$ utility scale boiler was developed. A robust and computationally inexpensive computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of the utility boiler was utilized to generate the solution dataset for surrogate model training and testing. In the present work, a standard multi-layer perception (MLP) and MLP connected mixture density network (MLP-MDN) machine learning architectures are compared for use as a surrogate model to predict the furnace heat loads and the flue-gas inlet conditions to the convective pass. A hyperparameter search was performed to find the best MLP and MLP-MDN architecture, with the MLP-MDN model being capable of predicting the uncertainty. The MLP-MDN showed approximately a 20\% decrease in the mean absolute error (MAE) and was selected for surrogate model integration. Validation of the integrated model against plant data was performed for a wide range of loads. Sufficient resolution of the thermofluid response was observed for all load ranges with a 5-8\% error discrepancy. The validated model was subsequently used to investigate the effects of using a poor-quality fuel for the 100\% maximum continuous rating (MCR) load case. The results show that poor quality fuel leads to a lower operational efficiency for the same operational inputs.
