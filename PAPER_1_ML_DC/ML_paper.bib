abstract = {Essentials of Monte Carlo Simulation focuses on the fundamentals of Monte Carlo methods using basic computer simulation techniques. The theories presented in this text deal with systems that are too complex to solve analytically. As a result, readers are given a system of interest and constructs using computer code, as well as algorithmic models to emulate how the system works internally. After the models are run several times, in a random sample way, the data for each output variable(s) of interest is analyzed by ordinary statistical methods. This book features 11 comprehensive chapters, and discusses such key topics as random number generators, multivariate random variates, and continuous random variates. Over 100 numerical examples are presented as part of the appendix to illustrate useful real world applications. The text also contains an easy to read presentation with minimal use of difficult mathematical concepts. Very little has been published in the area of computer Monte Carlo simulation methods, and this book will appeal to students and researchers in the fields of Mathematics and Statistics.},

abstract = {This paper describes a CFD modelling methodology used to evaluate the thermal performance of the water wall evaporator, platen and final stage superheaters of a subcritical pulverized coal-fired boiler at full and reduced boiler loads. The heat exchanger elements are modelled as explicit walls with an effective thermal resistance boundary condition rather than fixed wall temperatures. This enables the direct radiation component to be properly accounted for together with variations in the wall temperatures. The modelling approach was applied to the boiler of a 620 MWe power plant. The results for 99{\%}, 81{\%} and 60{\%} boiler loads compare well with experimental data. The proposed methodology forms the bases for a co-simulation framework which combines the CFD with a systems-level process modelling tool that can capture the internal steam maldistribution at low loads and the resultant effect on the metal temperatures.},

abstract = {A comprehensive thermal model of a combine harvester air conditioning system is developed to study the transient cool-down phenomena in the cabin. The proposed simulation framework encompasses a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that relies on an artificial neural network (ANN) which actively receives data on the performance of the refrigeration cycle in order to update the thermal state of the cabin. The refrigeration cycle is modeled using a 1D methodology to predict the heat absorption capacity of the evaporator at a wide range of operating conditions. The data generated by the 1D model is then utilized to train the ANN model with airflow, relative humidity (RH) and air temperature as input parameters and evaporator heat absorption as the output. The trained ANN model is integrated with the CFD model of the cabin allowing a realistic transient response of the evaporator based on the instantaneous thermal state of the cabin air. The proposed simulation framework exploits the versatility of ANN to simplify the overall complexity of the model and removes the necessity of 1D/3D co-simulation being the conventional method for this type of problems. The predicted transient thermal state of the cabin air is validated against experimental data and a substantial coherence of the numerical and experimental results is demonstrated.},

@techreport{bishop1994,
abstract = {Minimization of a sum-of-squares or cross-entropy error function leads to network out- puts which approximate the conditional averages of the target data, conditioned on the input vector. For classi?cations problems, with a suitably chosen target coding scheme, these averages represent the posterior probabilities of class membership, and so can be regarded as optimal. For problems involving the prediction of continuous variables, how- ever, the conditional averages provide only a very limited description of the properties of the target variables. This is particularly true for problems in which the mapping to be learned is multi-valued, as often arises in the solution of inverse problems, since the average of several correct target values is not necessarily itself a correct value. In order to obtain a complete description of the data, for the purposes of predicting the outputs cor- responding to new input vectors, we must model the conditional probability distribution of the target data, again conditioned on the input vector. In this paper we introduce a new class of network models obtained by combining a conventional neural network with a mixture density model. The complete system is called a Mixture Density Network, and can in principle represent arbitrary conditional probability distributions in the same way that a conventional neural network can represent arbitrary functions. We demonstrate the e?ectiveness of Mixture Density Networks using both a toy problem and a problem involving robot inverse kinematics.},

A new algorithm called best network after multiple iterations (BNMI) is introduced to help in determining the appropriate ANN architecture. The prediction performance of the developed models using BNMI algorithm was significantly better (between 6{\%} and 59{\%} better goodness of fit for various models) when compared to a previous study carried out by the authors which used the default single iteration ANN training algorithm of MATLAB{\textregistered}. The ANN models were further used to design the supervisory MPC for the residential HVAC system. The MPC generated the dynamic temperature set-point profiles of the zone air and buffer tank water which resulted in the operating cost reduction of the equipment without violating the thermal comfort constraints. When compared to the fixed set-point (FSP), MPC was able to save operating cost between 6{\%} and 73{\%} depending on the season.},

@article{Raman2019,
abstract = {Numerical simulations have played a vital role in the design of modern combustion systems. Over the last two decades, the focus of research has been on the development of the large eddy simulation (LES) approach, which leveraged the vast increase in computing power to dramatically improve predictive accuracy. Even with the anticipated increase in supercomputing capabilities, the use of LES in design is limited by its high computational cost. Moreover, to aid decision making, such LES computations have to be augmented to estimate underlying uncertainties in simulation components. At the same time, other changes are happening across industries that build or use combustion devices. While efficiency and emissions reduction are still the primary design objectives, reducing cost of operation by optimizing maintenance and repair is becoming an important segment of the enterprise. This latter quest is aided by the digitization of combustors, which allows collection and storage of operational data from a host of sensors over a fleet of devices. Moreover, several levels of computing including low-power hardware present on board the combustion systems are becoming available. Such large data sets create unique opportunities for design and maintenance if appropriate numerical tools are made available. As LES revolutionized computing-guided design by leveraging supercomputing, a new generation of numerical approaches is needed to utilize this vast amount of data and the varied nature of computing hardware. In this article, a review of emerging computational approaches for this heterogeneous data-driven environment is provided. A case is made that new but unconventional opportunities for physics-based combustion modeling exist in this realm.},

abstract = {There is increasing need for tighter controls of coal-fired plants due to more stringent regulations and addition of more renewable sources in the electricity grid. Achieving this will require better process knowledge which can be facilitated through the use of plant models. Drum-boilers, a key component of coal-fired subcritical power plants, have complicated characteristics and require highly complex routines for the dynamic characteristics to be accurately modelled. Development of such routines is laborious and due to computational requirements they are often unfit for control purposes. On the other hand, simpler lumped and semi empirical models may not represent the process well. As a result, data-driven approach based on neural networks is chosen in this study. Models derived with this approach incorporate all the complex underlying physics and performs very well so long as it is used within the range of conditions on which it was developed. The model can be used for studying plant dynamics and design of controllers. Dynamic model of the drum-boiler was developed in this study using NARX neural networks. The model predictions showed good agreement with actual outputs of the drum-boiler (drum pressure and water level).},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks offer an alternative way to tackle complex and ill-defined problems. They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data, are able to deal with non-linear problems, and once trained can perform predictions and generalisations at high speed. They have been used in diverse applications in control, robotics, pattern recognition, forecasting, medicine, power systems, manufacturing, optimisation, signal processing, and social/psychological sciences. They are particularly useful in system modelling, such as in implementing complex mapping and system identification. This paper presents various applications of neural networks in energy problems in a thematic rather than a chronological or any other way. Artificial neural networks have been used by the author in the field of solar energy; for modelling and design of a solar steam generating plant, for the estimation of a parabolic-trough collector's intercept factor and local concentration ratio and for the modelling and performance prediction of solar water-heating systems. They have also been used for the estimation of heating-loads of buildings, for the prediction of air flows in a naturally ventilated test room and for the prediction of the energy consumption of a passive solar building. In all such models, a multiple hidden-layer architecture has been used. Errors reported when using these models are well within acceptable limits, which clearly suggests that artificial neural-networks can be used for modelling in other fields of energy production and use. The work of other researchers in the field of energy is also reported. This includes the use of artificial neural-networks in heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, solar radiation, modelling and control of power-generation systems, load-forecasting and refrigeration. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {In the current work, an encoder-decoder mixture-density network (MDN) is developed using recurrent neural networks (RNN) for the prediction of utility-scale air-cooled condenser backpressure. Backpressure has a direct impact on thermal power plant generated load. The current study compares deterministic models (standard RNNs) to probabilistic models (MDN-RNNs). This is done using three datasets with increasing complexity to understand how significant the effects of plant operating parameters and ambient conditions are on the ACC back pressure. A hyperparameter search was performed to find the best encoder-decoder RNN architecture. An MDN layer was then attached to the selected architectures, to develop models capable of predicting the uncertainty. A two-layer encoder-decoder MDN-RNN model was selected and then trained with and without early stopping regularization active. The resultant models were combined using an ensemble approach. It was found that the ensemble model was able to achieve a better prediction of outliers without overfitting the data. The basic model, a standard RNN with the smallest input dimensionality achieved an average RMSE of 5.66 kPa whereas the end-to-end ensemble model (meta-MDN model trained using the highest dimensionality input) achieved an RMSE of 3.14 kPa which translate into a model accuracy increase from 68{\%} to 82{\%}.},

The VAE model is used to generate low dimensional encodings of the CFD data and the DNN is used in turn to map boundary conditions to the encodings. The results show that regularization is required during all training phases. Sufficiently accurate results were achieved for the reproduced species mass fractions with mean average errors below 0.3 [{\%}wt.].

The boiler was retrofitted by replacing traditional jet burners with RI-JET2 (Rapid Ignition - JET) swirl burners. This kind of solution is unique in power generation systems. The purpose of this work is to show how the flow, combustion performance and heat exchange in the furnace are affected by introducing rapid ignition phenomena in RI-JET2 burners instead of delayed ignition associated with the traditional jet burners. Results were compared to simulations of similarly designed boiler equipped with traditional jet burners. Furnace simulation was preceded with a single RI-JET2 burner simulation at the inlet to a virtual combustion chamber. The results have shown that pulverized coal (PC) concentrator separates the PC into two streams: concentric with fine particles and axial with coarse particles. Stable flame operation was noticed even without secondary and tertiary air swirl. 3D simulations of combustion chamber have shown that in a burner zone a visibly isolated, concentrated flame exists in the furnace axis.

In this method, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models are established for predicting the boiler operating and emission properties. To enhance the generalization of the ANN models, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is performed to generate some data as training samples for ANN modeling, together with the historical operating data. The inputs of the ANN models are unit load, coal properties, excess air and air distribution scheme, and the outputs are thermal efficiency and NOx emission. Based on the ANN models, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the air distribution scheme to achieve a higher thermal efficiency and lower NOx emission simultaneously. The predictions of the thermal efficiency and NOx emissions show a good agreement with the plant data, with mean errors of 0.04{\%} and 3.56 mg/Nm3, respectively. The results indicate that the use of CFD data can help generalize the ANN models. The application to a practical plant demonstrates that the proposed approach provides an effective tool for multi-objective optimization of pulverized-coal boiler performance with improved thermal efficiency and NOx emission control.},

abstract = {A data-driven surrogate model is proposed for a 64-cell air-cooled condenser system at a power plant. The surrogate model was developed using thermofluid simulation data from an existing detailed 1-D thermofluid network simulation model. The thermofluid network model requires a minimum of 20 min to solve for a single set of inputs. With operating conditions fluctuating constantly, performance predictions are required in shorter intervals, leading to the development of a surrogate model. Simulation data covered three operating scopes across a range of ambient air temperatures, inlet steam mass flow rates, number of operating cells, and wind speeds. The surrogate model uses multi-layer perceptron deep neural networks in the form of a binary classifier network to avoid extrapolation from the simulation dataset, and a regression network to provide performance predictions, including the steady-state backpressure, heat rejections, air mass flowrates, and fan motor powers on a system level. The integrated surrogate model had an average relative error of 0.3{\%} on the test set, while the binary classifier had a 99.85{\%} classification accuracy, indicating sufficient generalisation. The surrogate model was validated using site-data covering 10 days of operation for the case-study ACC system, providing backpressure predictions for all 1967 input samples within a few seconds of compute time. Approximately 93.5{\%} of backpressure predictions were within ±6{\%} of the recorded backpressures, indicating sufficient accuracy of the surrogate model with a significant decrease in compute time.},

abstract = {The arch-fired boiler easily suffers from membrane wall deformation and rupture caused by high stress. Thus, it is necessary to predict thermal stress distribution on the membrane wall for the sake of early warning. In this study, a lab-scale arch-fired boiler was constructed to achieve thermal stress distribution on the membrane wall, and the reason for high-stress formation was found. Besides, machine learning technology was first applied to predict thermal stress based on experimental data. The results show that both high-temperature distribution and boiler configuration play an important role on high-stress distribution. As for the prediction, the regression neural network model presents an admissible result (R2 = 0.724), but has a relatively poor performance on the high-stress prediction due to the skewed data distribution. Specifically, the relatively high prediction errors present on the bending and connection areas. Future work should consider the effect of boiler configuration and different heat loads. In contrast, the binary classification neural network model has a more accurate result with a high F1 score (0.893). It is the best choice for practical application considering the generality and accuracy. This work is meant to be valuable in optimizing the prediction model and applying it in practice.},

abstract = {We describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal 'hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure 1. {\textcopyright} 1986 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Coal blends are commonly used in pulverised fuel fired power plants. Past experience has shown that some coals exhibit synergistic effects when co-fired with other coals. Despite the recent progress in the field, there is still a general lack of understanding about how and why such synergistic effects take place. It is, therefore, imperative to develop reliable techniques to predict the combustion characteristics of coal blends. In the present paper, a commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, known as Fluent, is applied to simulate the combustion of binary coal blends of Australian black coals in a pilot-scale furnace. The modelling was mainly concerned with employing the two-mixture-fraction-pdf approach to separately track the individual components of each blend. Additionally, another approach, which takes the blend as a single coal with the weighted average properties of the components, was also used and compared. The main combustion characteristics of coal blends, such as ignition, burnout and NOx emissions were studied and corresponding predictions were validated against measurements in a pilot-scale furnace. The comparisons indicated that the CFD model with the two mixture fraction approach can successfully predict the non-additive (synergistic) combustion behaviour of coal blends, providing an effective tool for full-scale applications. The single coal approach presents nearly additive prediction of coal bends, and is only applicable to the blends of similar coals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
