abstract = {There is increasing need for tighter controls of coal-fired plants due to more stringent regulations and addition of more renewable sources in the electricity grid. Achieving this will require better process knowledge which can be facilitated through the use of plant models. Drum-boilers, a key component of coal-fired subcritical power plants, have complicated characteristics and require highly complex routines for the dynamic characteristics to be accurately modelled. Development of such routines is laborious and due to computational requirements they are often unfit for control purposes. On the other hand, simpler lumped and semi empirical models may not represent the process well. As a result, data-driven approach based on neural networks is chosen in this study. Models derived with this approach incorporate all the complex underlying physics and performs very well so long as it is used within the range of conditions on which it was developed. The model can be used for studying plant dynamics and design of controllers. Dynamic model of the drum-boiler was developed in this study using NARX neural networks. The model predictions showed good agreement with actual outputs of the drum-boiler (drum pressure and water level).},

@article{Laubscher2021,
abstract = {A novel integrated deep learning approach for data-driven surrogate modelling of combustion computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is presented. It combines variational autoencoders (VAEs) with deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict detail cell-by-cell two-dimensional distributions of temperature, velocity and species mass fractions from high level inputs such as velocity and fuel and air mass fractions. The VAE model is used to generate low dimensional encodings of the CFD data and the DNN is used in turn to map boundary conditions to the encodings. The results show that regularization is required during all training phases. Sufficiently accurate results were achieved for the reproduced species mass fractions with mean average errors below 0.3 [{\%}wt.]. The validation mean average percentage errors for the temperature and velocity fields are 1.7{\%} and 7.1{\%} respectively. It is therefore possible to predict detail two-dimensional contours of CFD solution data with adequate generalizability and accuracy.},

@article{Raidoo2022,
abstract = {In the current work, an encoder-decoder mixture-density network (MDN) is developed using recurrent neural networks (RNN) for the prediction of utility-scale air-cooled condenser backpressure. Backpressure has a direct impact on thermal power plant generated load. The current study compares deterministic models (standard RNNs) to probabilistic models (MDN-RNNs). This is done using three datasets with increasing complexity to understand how significant the effects of plant operating parameters and ambient conditions are on the ACC back pressure. A hyperparameter search was performed to find the best encoder-decoder RNN architecture. An MDN layer was then attached to the selected architectures, to develop models capable of predicting the uncertainty. A two-layer encoder-decoder MDN-RNN model was selected and then trained with and without early stopping regularization active. The resultant models were combined using an ensemble approach. It was found that the ensemble model was able to achieve a better prediction of outliers without overfitting the data. The basic model, a standard RNN with the smallest input dimensionality achieved an average RMSE of 5.66 kPa whereas the end-to-end ensemble model (meta-MDN model trained using the highest dimensionality input) achieved an RMSE of 3.14 kPa which translate into a model accuracy increase from 68{\%} to 82{\%}.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations have played a vital role in the design of modern combustion systems. Over the last two decades, the focus of research has been on the development of the large eddy simulation (LES) approach, which leveraged the vast increase in computing power to dramatically improve predictive accuracy. Even with the anticipated increase in supercomputing capabilities, the use of LES in design is limited by its high computational cost. Moreover, to aid decision making, such LES computations have to be augmented to estimate underlying uncertainties in simulation components. At the same time, other changes are happening across industries that build or use combustion devices. While efficiency and emissions reduction are still the primary design objectives, reducing cost of operation by optimizing maintenance and repair is becoming an important segment of the enterprise. This latter quest is aided by the digitization of combustors, which allows collection and storage of operational data from a host of sensors over a fleet of devices. Moreover, several levels of computing including low-power hardware present on board the combustion systems are becoming available. Such large data sets create unique opportunities for design and maintenance if appropriate numerical tools are made available. As LES revolutionized computing-guided design by leveraging supercomputing, a new generation of numerical approaches is needed to utilize this vast amount of data and the varied nature of computing hardware. In this article, a review of emerging computational approaches for this heterogeneous data-driven environment is provided. A case is made that new but unconventional opportunities for physics-based combustion modeling exist in this realm.},

@article{Sheng2004,
abstract = {Coal blends are commonly used in pulverised fuel fired power plants. Past experience has shown that some coals exhibit synergistic effects when co-fired with other coals. Despite the recent progress in the field, there is still a general lack of understanding about how and why such synergistic effects take place. It is, therefore, imperative to develop reliable techniques to predict the combustion characteristics of coal blends. In the present paper, a commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, known as Fluent, is applied to simulate the combustion of binary coal blends of Australian black coals in a pilot-scale furnace. The modelling was mainly concerned with employing the two-mixture-fraction-pdf approach to separately track the individual components of each blend. Additionally, another approach, which takes the blend as a single coal with the weighted average properties of the components, was also used and compared. The main combustion characteristics of coal blends, such as ignition, burnout and NOx emissions were studied and corresponding predictions were validated against measurements in a pilot-scale furnace. The comparisons indicated that the CFD model with the two mixture fraction approach can successfully predict the non-additive (synergistic) combustion behaviour of coal blends, providing an effective tool for full-scale applications. The single coal approach presents nearly additive prediction of coal bends, and is only applicable to the blends of similar coals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The paper presents 3Dnumerical investigation of OP-380 boiler tangentially-fired furnace utilizing bituminous coal. The boiler was retrofitted by replacing traditional jet burners with RI-JET2 (Rapid Ignition - JET) swirl burners. This kind of solution is unique in power generation systems. The purpose of this work is to show how the flow, combustion performance and heat exchange in the furnace are affected by introducing rapid ignition phenomena in RI-JET2 burners instead of delayed ignition associated with the traditional jet burners. Results were compared to simulations of similarly designed boiler equipped with traditional jet burners. Furnace simulation was preceded with a single RI-JET2 burner simulation at the inlet to a virtual combustion chamber. The results have shown that pulverized coal (PC) concentrator separates the PC into two streams: concentric with fine particles and axial with coarse particles. Stable flame operation was noticed even without secondary and tertiary air swirl. 3D simulations of combustion chamber have shown that in a burner zone a visibly isolated, concentrated flame exists in the furnace axis. This kind of flame shape reduces corrosion risk and furnace walls slagging as a result of RI-JET2 burner's long range. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Optimization techniques are presented with mathematical motivation, without extensive proofs, and with illustrative Julia code. This text is appropriate for an undergraduate or other introductory course on optimization. It is also suitable for a practicing engineer who wants a broad first taste of the field, along with access to working code. Compared with similar texts, this book generally includes a broader set of topics, including uncertainty propagation, multiobjective optimization, multidisciplinary optimization, Gaussian process surrogate models, and expression optimization. The authors provide the building blocks of optimization algorithms rather than presenting a deep treatment of optimization theory. This extensive use of Julia is the most noticeable innovation of the book. Functions and code are used to illustrate techniques as diverse as automatic differentiation, particle swarm optimization, and Bayesian Monte Carlo methods.

@article{Haffejee2021,
abstract = {A data-driven surrogate model is proposed for a 64-cell air-cooled condenser system at a power plant. The surrogate model was developed using thermofluid simulation data from an existing detailed 1-D thermofluid network simulation model. The thermofluid network model requires a minimum of 20 min to solve for a single set of inputs. With operating conditions fluctuating constantly, performance predictions are required in shorter intervals, leading to the development of a surrogate model. Simulation data covered three operating scopes across a range of ambient air temperatures, inlet steam mass flow rates, number of operating cells, and wind speeds. The surrogate model uses multi-layer perceptron deep neural networks in the form of a binary classifier network to avoid extrapolation from the simulation dataset, and a regression network to provide performance predictions, including the steady-state backpressure, heat rejections, air mass flowrates, and fan motor powers on a system level. The integrated surrogate model had an average relative error of 0.3{\%} on the test set, while the binary classifier had a 99.85{\%} classification accuracy, indicating sufficient generalisation. The surrogate model was validated using site-data covering 10 days of operation for the case-study ACC system, providing backpressure predictions for all 1967 input samples within a few seconds of compute time. Approximately 93.5{\%} of backpressure predictions were within ±6{\%} of the recorded backpressures, indicating sufficient accuracy of the surrogate model with a significant decrease in compute time.},
